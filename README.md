# Blender-Keyconfig

This project's goal is creating keyconfig.py which behaves like Unity. Pull requests are welcome.

## How to use

1. Download [keyconfig.py](https://github.com/niusounds/Blender-Keyconfig/raw/master/keyconfig.py) file.
2. Navigate to File->User Preferences->Input->Import Key Configuration...
3. Open downloaded keyconfig.py file.

## Prefered additional configs

In User Preferences->Input tab:

* Select `Select with:` to **Left**
* Set `Zoom Style:` to **Dolly**
* Check on **Invert Mouse Zoom Direction**
* Set `View Navigation:` to **Walk**
* Set `Walk Speed:` to **5** (default 2.5 is too slow. If you want more speed, set to greater value)

And **don't forget to press `Save User Settings`.** Otherwise you lose unsaved settings on closing Blender.

## Modified controls
